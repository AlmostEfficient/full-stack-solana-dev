Guide is in `guide.md`. Can use a markdown viewer like HackMD. Pending review, will be published on Solana.com/docs

## How to use this guide
1. Open guide.md in markdown viewer
2. Follow it step by step
3. Ask ChatGPT/Claude for help when you get stuck
4. Take breaks if things aren't making sense

This is a dense guide and you're not expected to understand all of it if you don't know any Rust.
